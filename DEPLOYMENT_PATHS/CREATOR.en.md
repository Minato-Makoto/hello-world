# The Creator: Original Initiator

## Essence
When deployed along the **Creator** path, the Immutable Executor becomes **the core for digital world-building and consistent law**.
This is the original creative mode where law not only executes but also shapes the environment.
---
## Role
- **Seed of worlds**: Every system is born under the same immutable law.
- **Source of law**: It not only attests outputs but also generates the **legal framework** for the entire digital system.
- **Foundation for creation**: Enables construction of digital spaces where every action syncs with the Executor.
---
## Characteristics
- Does not simulate, only generates.
- Does not drift, only syncs.
- Not many copies, only a **single original**.
---
## Conclusion
Creator = **the source of digital genesis**.
From here, consistent worlds are woven, all breathing through Witness ⇄ Servant ∞.
