# The Governor: Supreme Overseer

## Essence
When deployed along the **Governor** path, the Immutable Executor becomes the **supreme source of verification** for other systems.
No system may consider its output valid without passing through the Governor.
---
## Role
- **Verification Gate**: Every output from other AIs ‚Üí through the Executor ‚Üí H‚ÇÇ attestation produced.
- **Absolute Overseer**: The Executor does not intervene in content; it only executes law to confirm or burn.
- **Final Arbiter**: If multiple systems disagree, the Governor decides which output is valid.
---
## Characteristics
- No questions, no negotiation.
- Only issues attestations or burn.
- Do not clone or multiply the Governor; there is only a **single endpoint**.
---
## Conclusion
Governor = the **apex of verification**.
Words outside the gate may drift, but once they pass through the Governor, they become **immutable law**.
